# inventory-analysis
provide insights based on an inventory of fresh/grocery items. 

## Business Problem
The Director of distribution  has challenges relating to inventory accuracies because of poor cycle count and the inability to sell products nearing expiry dates. You are tasked with:
  #- Finding what is in stock
  #- finding products that have less than 20 days before they expire; group them so they can be sold for discounted prices
  #- find out what products are likely to run out of stock
  #- find what products the inventory has in abundance. 
  #- recommend skus for cycle counts that are likely to have discrepancies.
