# inventory-analysis
provide insights based on an inventory of fresh/grocery items. 

## Business Problem
The Director of supply has been having a lot of challenges relating to inventory accuracies because of poor cycle counting and the inability to sell products nearing their expiry dates. You are tasked with:
  #### Finding what is in stock
  #### finding products that have less than 20 days before they expire; group them so they can be sold for discounted prices
  #### find out what products are likely to run out of stock
  #### find what products the inventory has in abundance. 
  #### recommend skus for cycle counts that are likely to have discrepancies
